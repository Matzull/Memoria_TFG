\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

An innovative solution is presented in the field of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), focusing on the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). The developed tool consists of a system designed to collect, process, and analyze real-time data from APRS packet transmitters.

The utility of the APRS reporting system extends to diverse contexts such as weather station monitoring, emergency resource management, and vehicle tracking. However, the complexity of data generated by APRS transmitters and the lack of specialized tools for analysis hinder the extraction of relevant information and the identification of significant patterns.

The proposed solution addresses this need by providing a platform for the automated collection of APRS data, processing it to extract relevant information, and analyzing it to identify patterns. The goal is to assist users in extracting useful information from the collected data.
